# *Great Books* Seminars at Skuid
Before our seminars, we'll read short passages (3-10 pages) of *great books*.  During seminar, we'll try to understand the readings together through discussion.  Discussion will follow a very simple but particular model I picked up at my alma mater, St. John's College.  This way of discussion (see below) is as important as the readings themselves.  Readings will be on any subject and from any genre (philosophy, poetry, political theory, mathematics, art etc).  See the list here to get a general idea: [Adler's List](https://github.com/altphi/seminar/raw/master/files/AdlersList.pdf) and others.

First-timers should read [Klein • Discussion as a Means of Learning](https://github.com/altphi/seminar/raw/master/files/Klein%20%E2%80%A2%20Discussion%20as%20a%20Means%20of%20Learning.pdf).

Join the Slack channel at #seminar.

We'll meet from 12pm to 1pm every Tuesday (see calendar event for the meeting room).

## How to *do* discussion
* Always address one another as Mr./Ms. LastName.
* At the beginning of a seminar, articulate to the group at least one question about the reading.
* After that we try to answer each others' questions using the text alone, i.e. avoid name dropping or [references to external sources](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIbg7oiXECE) as this excludes anyone who hasn't read that source from the conversation.  
* Speak respectfully.  If you disagree with something, disagree with the idea at hand, not the person who stated it, and use the text to clarify your thoughts.
* Continually bring the conversation back to the text at hand.
* Try to draw in all present.  Make connections, synthesize as much as you can of others' thoughts and state it before adding your new thought.
* Never worry about not knowing, or not understanding -- genuine effort will always reward you.
* Expect to continue the discussion as you bump into fellow group members outside seminar: over lunch, at a pub, in passing.  These are some of the best times for 'spontaneous learning.'
